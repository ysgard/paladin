# Paladin

Paladin is a simple, self-contained program that automatically
generates a cabal scaffold and git repository for new Haskell
projects.  It is a fork of Yann Esposito's (@yogsototh) 'holy-project'
but pared down and simplified.

* It creates a project directory and cabal project file using sane
  versions of the provided project name.  For example, if you specify
  your project as "My uber awesome project" the directory (and
  project) will be named 'my-uber-awesome-project'.

* It initializes a cabal sandbox for you

* It provides an initial source file, 'src/Main.hs' and gives it a
  module name derived from your project.   Following the example
  above, the module will be 'MyUberAwesomeProject'.  The initial
  source file also comes with some initial Haddock documentation.

* It initializes a git repo for you.

* It dumps an MIT license file.

* Unlike Holy, which is a cabal package, Paladin's templates are built
  into the executable and thus only the executable is needed to
  generate the scaffolding.  At this point, the scaffolding is not customizable.

Paladin is based on Yann Esposito's 'Holy-Haskell-Starter', which is here:
